Because we do not distribute the SenchaTouch library,
you will need to download it from [Sencha site](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/).

Then you will need to unpack it, and put all javascript files from
*sencha-touch-x.x.x/* directory to this directory.

The next step you probably will need to edit *../index.html* file
to fix exact file names.
