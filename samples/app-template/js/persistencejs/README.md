Because we do not distribute the Persistence.js library,
you will need to download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/zefhemel/persistencejs).

Then you will need to unpack it, and put all javascript files from
*lib/* directory to this directory.

The next step you probably will need to edit *../index.html* file
to fix exact file names.
