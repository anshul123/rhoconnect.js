Because we do not distribute the PhoneGap library,
you will need to download it from [PhoneGap site](http://www.phonegap.com).

Then you will need to unpack it, and put all javascript files from
*phonegap-x.x.x/Android/* directory to this directory.

The next step you probably will need to edit *../index.html* file
to fix exact file names.
