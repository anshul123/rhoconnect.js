Samples
===

This directory contain samples of using RhoConnect.js with 3rd-party libraries and frameworks.
Each sample have separate directory and may be used separately. The only action you may need to
run it outside of this dir is to edit references to appropriate js/css files.

Also, this directory contains Sinatra demo application. It hosts online samples which isn't required
to be installed on device. Look at application.rb and rhoconnect-sencha.erb for example.

Sinatra application isn't required part. It just helps to host and access samples online.
