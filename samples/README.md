Samples
===

This directory consists of samples on how to use RhoConnect.js with 3rd-party libraries and frameworks.
Each sample have separate directory and may be used separately. The only action you may need to
run it outside of project directory structure is to edit references to appropriate js/css files.

Also, this directory contains Sinatra demo application. It hosts online samples which isn't required
to be installed on device. Look at *application.rb* and *rhoconnect-sencha.erb* for example. Look for
*config.ru* in the parent directory.

Sinatra application isn't required part of samples. It just helps to host and access samples online.
